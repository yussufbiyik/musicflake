## Features

- Weather based playlist recommendation
- Basic, readable UI


## Known Issues
1. Does not recommend any playlist when the user asks for a recommendation for the first time
### Possible Reasons of Issues

#### First Issue
```weather.service.ts:52``` does not return any value for the first time so the function returns "error is logged" message when there are no appearent errors that are catched by the catch block (line 65).
## Roadmap

### TODO:
- Fix known issues
- Clean and comment the code
- Delete unused code or fix unreleased broken features that are causing these code lines

### Maybe Someday
- AI assisted music recommendation from the user's own liked songs

## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file which should be located in a folder named as "environments", this folder includes two files: "environment.prod.ts" and "environment.ts"

Both of the files export the same variable which is:

```javascript
export const environment = {
    production: true, // Change to false if the file name is environment.ts
    firebaseConfig:{
        apiKey: "",
        authDomain: "",
        databaseURL: "",
        projectId: "",
        storageBucket: "",
        messagingSenderId: "",
        appId: "",
        measurementId: ""
    }
};
```

To run the project locally, all you need to change is firebase config which is something you can get by enabling firebase hosting.
